# Number Guessing Game

This game is inspired by wordle. It is designed to be played once per day.

* The program will generate a random number between one and one million 

* The user will be allowed 20 guesses to identify the number

* If the user's guess is too low, the program will inform the user that their guess was too low and prompt them to guess a higher number

* If the user's guess is too high, the program will inform the user that their guess was too high and prompt them to guess a lower number

* The game continues until either the user guesses the number correctly, or 20 incorrect guesses have been made
